=================
What we did:

1. Dataset generation
we took the 125.phy olaf dataset, and extracted the 2 suspicous sequences as well as 3 random, generating the 5_new_seqs  and the 120.phy dataset (see folder reduced_dataset), then we generated a reference tree with 120 taxa with RAxML by doing a  normal search (RAxML_info.RT120), this is what we call reference_tree.newick

2. EPA search to get all placements
/home/izquiefo/phd/raxml/standard-RAxML/raxmlHPC-SSE3 -f v -s ../mt-co1_Rotifera.phylip -t RAxML_bestTree.RT120 -n EPA_ALLENTRIES -m GTRCAT

generates all the placements (RAxML_portableTree.EPA_ALLENTRIES.jplace) given the full alignment and the reference tree

3. Get the taxonomy in a format we van compare with the placements

Olaf data was with genbank ids, but the taxonomy we get is with ncbi, thus we had to:

Execute in this order to get a  taxonomy with genbank ids from a phylip alignment

get_genbank_entries.rb # takes genbankid from the phylip file and downloads
extract_taxonomy_id.rb # takes the genbank entries from folder and outputs taxalist.txt

Now we can generate taxaList.txt, which is the second column of taxalist.txt (just the ncbi ids)
../../extractTaxonomy.py ../../ncbi.dmp taxaList > taxonomy.out   # the ncbi taxonomy

translate_taxonomy.rb  # takes taxalist.txt to traduce taxonomy.out into taxonomy_a_la_genbank.out 


4. Now we run our scripts, which compares "taxonomy-aware" placements against best placements to see if sth. has been mislabeled
./tree.py data/olaf/reduced_dataset/RAxML_portableTree.EPA_ALLENTRIES.jplace
data/olaf/taxonomy_a_la_genbank.out > output_analysis_olaf
