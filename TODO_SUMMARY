The problem setup is the following:
Given an alignment with n taxa, a multifurcating ncbi taxonomy with n
taxa, and a strictly bifurcating ML reference tree with k < n taxa
(T_ref), we want to check whether the (n-k) new species are outliers
(or have been mislabeled in the taxonomy). We assume that the ML
reference tree is reasonably similar to the taxonomy.

1. EPA-based strategy (2 steps)
We run the EPA-ALL_ENTRIES version of raxml with -s alignment -t
T_ref. This will provide us all possible placements of each new
sequence (one by one) in tips and inner branches. Each placement
includes the LH weight and the LH of the tree of (k+1) taxa.

We run tree.py placements_output taxonomy. This will , for each sequence:
- output the tree LH for the best ML placement and its weight (note
the placement may be a tip or an inner branch)
- find the siblings of the sequence in the taxonomy, and make a list.
For each element in the list, output LH of the tree and LH weight.
These are what we call "taxonomy-aware placements"

For example:
./tree.py data/olaf/reduced_dataset/RAxML_portableTree.EPA_ALLENTRIES.jplace
data/olaf/taxonomy_a_la_genbank.out > output_analysis_olaf

2. EPA-based strategy TODO
- Extend the code so that the list includes not only the siblings but
also all internal branches up to the LCA (least common ancestor). We
can then sum all LH weights from that list.
- Also keep track of the distance between ML best placement and the
taxonomy-aware placements
- Present the results as a sorted list. Sequences where the ML
placement has a weight close to 1 and the taxonomy-aware placements
sum up to a value close to 0 (and are far away) are candidates to be
mislabeled

3. Biological data (Olaf dataset)
- This datasets comprises 125 taxa, out of which 2 are considered to
be mislabeled (see README in data/olaf).
- We took those 2 out together with 3 others and inferred a reference
tree (T_ref) of 120 taxa.
- Then we ran method described in (1) and got the output as saved in
the file output_analysis_olaf (on gets identified, the other
constitutes a special case: no siblings)

4. Biological dataset (Smith)
@Stephen we had a look at the data you shared with Andre (see
data/smith) but did not figure out how we can use it to test this.

5. Simulated dataset
- We can simulate data, get a true tree and a true  taxonomy
(initially we can make the taxonomy strictly bifurcating to make
things easier), and simply swap taxa to fabricate mislabeled species
(also keeping track of how far away they are).

So the idea would be to have a good setup to run this method and
compare it with the one Stephen has developed. We should coordinate
that we use the same simulated/biological datasets and try to evaluate
both methods on the same data.
